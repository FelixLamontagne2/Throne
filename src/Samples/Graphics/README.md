# Graphics samples

## Simple window
This sample is a very simple window with basic window events.

## Triangle
Almost the same as the Simple window, but renders a triangle.

## Models
Renders a textured model that is dynamically loaded using the GLTF format. By default, it renders a model of the voyager 1 scape probe, but in theory it should be able to render most gltf models.
