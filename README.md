# Throne

Throne is a modern c++ game engine that is currently a work in progress.

# Examples

There is currently no complete examples, but there is many unit tests that show the usage of some utilities.
Complete examples will be added in the future.

# Ideologies and Objectives

Throne aims to be as efficient as possible and uses the zero cost abstraction principle as much as possible. Obviously we can't claim to be the most efficient game engine, but we're trying to make it as good as we can. The goal is to create an api that is easy to use but also flexible. We also want to make it portable and usable on at least Windows and Linux. Making the egnine as modern as possible is one of the goal and to achieve this we use the most modern version of c++.
